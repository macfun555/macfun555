Hi, macfun555 or macfuns is one of my most used online names. Programming is one of my many different hobbies.
I know Python, Java, and a little small amount of C and C++

I don't exactly know why am I writing a long about me message...gotta write this anyways lol

I've worked in some fields (most of them being private projects, failed or abandoned) with many nice people.
Recently, I've decided to take a long (if not forever) break from coding and focus on what I currently love instead: being a music producer, songwriter, and artist. So this place is gonna be a little goofy....wooo

my discord: macfuns#4858
