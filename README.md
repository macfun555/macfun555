Hi, macfun555 is one of my most used online name. Programming is one of my many different hobbies.
I know Python, Java and a little small amount of C and C++

I don't exactly know why am I writing a long about me message...gotta write this anyways lol

I've worked on some fields (most of them being privated project, failed or abandoned) with many nice people.
Recenty, I've decided to take a long (if not forever) break from coding and focuses on what I currently love instead : being a music producer, song writer and an artist. So this place is gonna be a little goofy....wooo

it's getting too dark id like to go to sleep now bye bye xd
