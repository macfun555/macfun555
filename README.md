Hi, macfun555 or macfuns is one of my most used online names. Programming is one of my many different hobbies.
I know Python, Java, and a bit of C and C++

I'm the type of person who commits changes to this file more than the actual projects :skull:.

I've worked in some fields (most of them being private projects, failed or abandoned) with many nice people.
Recently, I've decided to take a long (if not forever) break from coding and focus on what I am currently interested instead: being a music producer, songwriter, artist, and Youtuber. So this place is gonna be a little goofy....wooo

my discord: macfuns#4858
